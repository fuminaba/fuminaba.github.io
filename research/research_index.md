# Research Interests

<p style = 'text-align: justify;'>
My research interests are primarily in deep learning-based computer vision applications in medical imaging. 
More specifically, I'm interested in exploring novel and interpretable methods to extract meaningful insights 
from complex medical images utilizing attention mechanisms, semi-supervised learning etc. 
For instance, both tissue architecture/growth patterns and individual cell characteristics may be clinically relevant in cancer.
