## Consulting Services
If you've landed on this page, you're likely interested in: 
1. Transitioning into a career in biostatistics or biomedical AI, 
2. Integrating AI into your field, research or business,
3. Or, perhaps you're a student struggling with your last statistics requirement for your degree...

<p style = 'text-align:justify;'>
In a world where Large Language Model (LLM) -based tools can only get you so far, my consulting services aim to fill the gap that LLMs fail to address. Here, you can get:
<ul>
<li><b>Career planning and advice</b> - strengthen your portfolio with guided projects relevant to your career and expertise</li>
<li><b>Integrating AI into your workflows</b> - consultation on the best way to integrate AI tools into your business or research for efficient pipelines</li>
<li><b>Tutoring and guided learning</b> - learn statistics, data science and biomedical machine learning in a way that suits you</li>
</ul>
