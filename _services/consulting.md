## Why might large-language models (LLM) not be enough for me?
<p style = 'text-align: justify;'>
To be honest, LLM tools (like ChatGPT, Claude, Llama etc...) are extremely useful tools. I use it day-to-day to help with my writing, coding, brainstorming etc. For most things, these tools (even the free version!) is enough. There's a reason the stock value of Chegg dropped significantly following OpenAI's first major release - it was like a better version of search engines like Google which actually 'understood' your questions and could provide answers as if you were talking to a humanized version of a textbook.

<p style = 'text-align: center;'><i>So... if LLM tools are so great, why might my services be useful? Let's dive into the theoretical limitations of LLMs - and how I can cover those gaps?</i></p>

## Theoretical Limitations of LLMs
<p style = 'text-align: justify;'>
LLMs are great text-predictors: it answers with text it believes is most appropriate for the situation based on the text which was used to train it. Another limitation of generative models - it 'responds' by generating text given an input - so there is a limitation in how much context and information it can 'remember' while giving responses. Therefore, it is a great query engine - but limitations exist in its 'problem-solving' capabilities. While AI agents are a trillion dollar problem which large tech companies are racing to solve, its current capabilities are still limited. So here I am!
