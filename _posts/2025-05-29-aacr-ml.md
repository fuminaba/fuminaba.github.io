**Description:** I will be presenting a poster at the AACR Special Conference in Cancer Research: Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning!  

My abstract titled ***Multiple Instance Learning of Large-scale DNA Organization to Characterize Prostate Cancer Aggressiveness*** 
has been accepted for a poster presentation at the [AACR Special Conference in Cancer Research: Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning](https://www.aacr.org/meeting/aacr-special-conference-in-cancer-research-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning/) happening on July 10-12, 2025 in Montreal.

In this work, we leverage a light-weight multiple instance learning (MIL) model which considers both cell-level labels and patient-level labels 
to analyze large-scale DNA organization (LDO) within cell nuclei - such as size, shape, and organization of DNA within the nucleus - for prostate cancer patient prognosis.
We found that the LDO score - the score describing a patient's probability of PCa specific mortality - was associated to treatment response and Gleason score.
