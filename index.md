## Biography

<img src="/assets/fumi_face.jpg" alt="drawing" width="200" style = 'float:right; margin-left: 25px'/>
<p style = "text-align: justify;">
I'm a PhD student in the Interdisciplinary Oncology Program at the University of British Columbia. My research focuses on radiopathomics &rarr; effective integration of radiological and pathological images for enhanced clinical insights. Combining imaging modalities of two different physical scales may provide details unavailable from each modality alone, making it a great candidate for cancer prognoses, early lesion detection and predictive applications.

## About Me
<p style = "text-align: justify;">
My interest in leveraging statistical and machine learning based image analysis for cancer prognoses and early detection originates from my undergraduate studies. During my Bachelor's of Medical Laboratory Sciences program at the University of British Columbia (UBC), I worked first-hand with histopathology sections, staining/imaging and learning how medical images provide invaluable insight into many pathologies. Seeing how machine learning and quantitative image analysis is transforming the discipline further, I became curious. Initially as a volunteer, then as a research assistant, I deepened my understanding of statistics, machine/deep learning and computer vision - leading to my current position.
